Purchase-Only House Price Index for Manufactured Homes,,,,
"Note: These indexes are experimental in nature. The manufactured homes data include information for homes titled as real estate and not chattel. Details concerning the index construction can be found in the Highlights article for the 2018Q2 HPI release. FHFA is still considering whether to update the measures in the future and future revisions may reflect modeling and data filtering refinements. If the experimental data are revised, the updates may not be published with the same regularity as FHFA’s standard monthly and quarterly house price indexes. Comments, questions, and suggestions should be addressed to hpihelpdesk@fhfa.gov.",,,,
